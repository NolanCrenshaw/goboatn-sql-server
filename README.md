*I'll make a proper README.md in the future, here's the quick and dirty.*

- Make sure you have docker-compose
- Clone the repository
- Create an .env modeled after the .env.example with your own variables
- You can change the .yml if you don't want this container to always restart. It's setup to always run.
- Run the docker-compose commands that you need. ```docker-compose up``` up will get you going.
